The files found in this repository were used to investigate the inertia bound, also known as the Cvetkovic bound.

# Inertia Bound
The inertia bound is defined as follows:
**Inertia Bound** - Let G be a graph on *n* vertices, and *W* be a weight matrix of *G*. Then the following inequality holds:
$$\alpha(G)\leq n_0 +\min\{n_+,n_-\}.$$
